AdmixInfer
=================================================
Short Description:
AdmixInfer is designed to optimize the parameters of admixture model
via maximum likelihood estimation and figure out the model best fit 
the data. The optimization is under assumption of HI, GA, CGFR and 
CGFD model.

1.Compile
It's very easy to compile from the source code by the following 
commands:

bash$ tar -zvxf AdmixInfer.tar.gz
bash$ cd AdmixInfer/src
bash$ make

After compiling, you will find the executable AdmixInfer, just
typing the command below to get help information:

bash$ ./AdmixInfer -h

2. Test with the toy data

bash$ ./AdmixInfer -f ../example/Uygur.seg -m 200 -c 0.01 -o ../example/Uygur.llk
Which will read the ancestral tracks from Uygur.seg, search the generation from
1 to 200, the cutoff to discard short tracks is 0.01 Morgan, and finally, the likelihoods
are save to the file Uygur.llk for further reference

Results summary is also print to the screen, for example:

Results summary
Parental-population1: CEU
Admix-proportion: 0.428372; standard-deviation: 0.00179507
Admix-time: 55.7721; standard-deviation: 0.419461
Optimal-model(s): GA(100%); 


3. File formats
3.1 Input file format
AdmixInfer is easy to use, only need one file, in which each line represents the start and
end points, and which ancestry the track originates from, and chromosome. For example:
0.00000000      0.34602058      Yoruba 1
0.34602058      0.34614778      French 1
......
0.40759031      0.41517938      Yoruba 22
Here start and end points unit are in Morgan.

3.2 Output file format
AdmixInfer save the likelihoods of each generation searched under different models assumption
for further reference, the format is straightforward:
chr1
Generation      HI      GA      CGFR    CGFD
1       -522.625        -522.625        -522.625        -522.625
2       -52.7604        -177.942        -135.031        -166.291
......
chr22
Generation      HI      GA      CGFR    CGFD
1       -108.11		-108.11 	-108.11 	-108.11
2       -6.72091    -33.6433 	-24.8894	-30.6868
......
99      328.038 	348.171 	350.288 	351.177
100     326.962 	347.958 	350.213 	351.21

4. Full Arguments
-h/--help
if you forget the usage of any arguments, don't hesitate to use this one

-f/--file <filename>
This argument is required, in which to specify the input file of ancestral tracks, format as
described previous section

-m/--max [generation]
This argument is optional, in which user can specify the maximum generation search from. 
Default is 500 generation, corresponding ~15000 years before present.

-c/--cutoff [value]
This argument is optional, in which user can specify the threshold to discard short tracks in 
case of uncertainty of inference about short tracks. Default is 0, use all the tracks

-o/--output [out_filename]
This argument is also optional, in which user can specify the filename of output, to save
the likelihoods for each generation under HI, GA, CGFR and CGFD model assumptions
